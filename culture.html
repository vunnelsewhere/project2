	      <h2>MacLehose Trail</h2>
	      <p>The MacLehose Trail is the oldest trail in Hong Kong, 100km long with 200 distance posts.</p>
	      <p>It is named after Sir Murray MacLehose, the 25th Governor of Hong Kong, an enthusiastic hiker who established the Country Parks.</p>
	      <p>This is the Grandaddy of the Hong Kong hikes. An unforgiving 100km hike up and down some of Hong Kong’s highest peaks and through it’s most stunning landscapes. Beautiful beaches and coastlines, urban views over Kowloon, ridges, peaks, forests, jungles, reservoirs, grassland, monkeys, this hike has the lot. It’s not to be taken lightly though, you’ll be covering over 7000m in elevation gain, that’s close to hiking sea level to the summit of Mount Everest.</p>

	      <h2>The Big Buddha</h2>
	      <p>The Hong Kong Big Buddha in Lantau Island is one of the largest seated Buddha statues in the world.</p>
	      <p>It is a popular tourist attraction and source of pride for Hong Kong residents for what it represents spiritually, culturally, and from an artistic and engineering standpoint.</p>
	      <p>The statue, itself, is 34 meters tall (112 feet), and constructed of over 200 bronze pieces weighing in at over 250 metric tonnes. Visitors must ascend 268 steps to reach the base of the statue, which sits at 482 meters (1,581 feet) above sea level.</p>

	      <h2>Temple Street Night Market</h2>
	      <p>The place is sometimes known as "Men's Street".</p>
	      <p>Covering multiple city blocks from Man Ming Lane in the north to Nanking St in the south, Temple St is cleaved in two by the Tin Hau Temple complex. In the 1920s, vendors gathered there to serve temple-goers; a century on, the crowds descend nightly for cheap clothes and watches, street food, trinkets and teaware. Marked prices are mere suggestions – this is a place to bargain.</p>
	      <p>To reach the market, take exit C2 from the Jordan MTR station and walk along Bowring St, or exit C from the Yau Ma Tei MTR station and follow Man Ming Lane.</p>
